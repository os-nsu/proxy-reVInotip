Proxy template

This repository contains the proxy interface and file structure.
  
The implementation must comply with this interface, and there are 
no other restrictions (unless otherwise specified in the lab assignment).

The labN branch contains the interface for the Nth lab.  Note that the new
lab always extends the interface, but does not change already existed parts of it.
